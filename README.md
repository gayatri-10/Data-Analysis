**#Data Analysis :#** Data analysis involves inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, inform conclusions, and support decision-making.
# Key Components of Data Analysis
**Data Collection:**Gathering data from various sources, such as surveys, databases, web scraping, or APIs.
**Data Cleaning:**Removing inaccuracies, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies to ensure the data is reliable.
**Data Exploration:**Using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the data's structure, patterns, and relationships.
**Data Transformation:**Modifying the data format or structure (e.g., normalization, aggregation) to prepare it for analysis.
**Data Modeling:**Applying statistical or machine learning models to analyze the data and extract insights. This could involve regression analysis, clustering, classification, etc.
**Data Visualization:**Creating charts, graphs, and dashboards to visually communicate findings and insights in an understandable way.
**Interpretation:**Making sense of the results and determining their implications for the problem or question being addressed.
**Reporting:**Summarizing findings in a report or presentation, highlighting key insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

In this Repository I've shared my Data Analysis Projects. These projects are for educational purpose and to showcase the concepts that I have learnt about Data Analysis!! I have used the following tools for Data Analysis :
**Programming Languages:** Python
**Data Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
